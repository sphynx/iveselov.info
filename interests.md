## Interests

Well, the things which make me enthusiastic tend to be changing over
the time, so here will be present only the current snapshot of
interests in addition to a couple of eternal topics which make me feel
a bit geeky through all of my life.

### Mathematics

Especially [recreational][rec] one. Enjoyed Martin Gardner books, Conway's
Game of Life (modelling it on old postal box turned into a board) and
similar stuff.

### Functional programming

For some reason I feel mesmerized by all these lambda concepts,
closures, monads. Maybe because it's simply beautiful?

### Chess

The eternal game, very deep and addictive, you can spend a whole life
trying to master it and still fail

### Linux (and any *nix in general)

Feeling free even in OS sense is just great!

### Classic movies

I enjoy watching gems of great directors: Krzysztof Kieślowski, Reiner
Werner Fassbinder, Luis Buñuel, Alphred Hichkok, Miloš Forman.
