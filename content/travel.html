<p>
  I like to travel! Usually I prefer "backpacker's style":

  <ul>
    <li>planning my own route</li>
    <li>hitch-hiking</li>
    <li>contacting with local people</li>
    <li>trying to find a place to stay on wonderful
      <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/veselov/">couchsurfing.org</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

</p>

<p>
  I believe this is the best way to travel, since this way the world usually
  turns its better side to you, showing lots of interesting and helpful people and
  nice hidden places.
</p>

<p>
  The list of the countries is not that impressive, but I'm working on it!
