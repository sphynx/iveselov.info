<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
  Well, the things which make me enthusiastic tend to be changing over the time,
  so here will be present only the current snapshot of interests in addition to
  a couple of eternal topics which make me feel a bit geeky through all of my life.

  <dl>
    <dt>Mathematics</dt>
    <dd>
      especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics">recreational</a>
      one. Enjoyed Martin Gardner books, Conway's Game of Life (modelling it on
      old postal box turned into a board) and similar stuff.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Functional programming</dt>
    <dd>
      for some reason I feel mesmerized by all these lambda concepts, closures,
      monads. Maybe because it's simply beautiful?
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Chess</dt>
    <dd>
      the eternal game, very deep and addictive, you can spend a whole
      life trying to master it and still fail
    </dd>

    <dt>Linux</dt>
    <dd>
      feeling free even in OS sense is just great! At the moment I'm using
      Windows though, but the things are going to change soon.
    </dd>

    <dt>Classic movies</dt>
    <dd>
      I enjoy watching gems of great directors: Krzysztof Kieślowski, Reiner
      Werner Fassbinder, Luis Buñuel, Alphred Hichkok, Miloš Forman.
