<h3>Petals around the rose</h3>

<article>
  <p>
    The name of the game is "Petals Around the Rose". The name is
    really <strong>important</strong>. I will roll five dice and ask you to
    guess the score for the roll. The score will always be zero or an even
    number. Your mission is to work out how the score is calculated. That's
    easy, even Bill Gates
    <a href="http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-bg.htm">managed to do</a>
      ;)

  <p>
    <strong>Instructions.</strong> As you can see, the first roll is already in
    place. It's time to guess! Type in your guess and click on "Check" to see
    the correct answer. Then try to figure out what's wrong and either click on
    "Roll" for another turn, or enjoy the solution if you are sure you solved it
    properly. Good luck, have fun!
