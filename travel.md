## Travel

I like to travel! Usually I prefer "backpacker's style":

- planning my own route
- hitch-hiking
- contacting local people
- trying to find a place to stay on wonderful [CouchSurfing]

I believe this is the best way to travel, since this way the world
usually turns its better side to you, showing lots of interesting and
helpful people and nice hidden places.

I like geographical maps, so I've created one here. The list of
visited countries is not that impressive, but this is a continuous
work in progress! :)
